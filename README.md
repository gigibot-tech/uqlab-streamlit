## Flavours

This template is available in different flavours, which are represented by different branches, make sure to pull the correct branch for your use case:

| Branch                  | Auth                   | UI        | Pros             | Cons               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `oauth-proxy`           | OAuth proxy with IdP   | Carbon    | prod-friendly    | Needs AppID        |
| `oauth-proxy-custom-ui` | OAuth proxy with IdP   | shadcn/ui | prod-friendly    | Needs AppID        |
| `local-auth`            | In‑app user management | Carbon    | easy to start up | less prod-friendly |
| `local-auth-custom-ui`  | In‑app user management | shadcn/ui | easy to start up | less prod-friendly |
| `backend-only`          | API Key                | —         |
| `backend-only-no-db`    | API Key                | —         |

<br />

> The custom-ui flavours are easily adaptable to look like any customers UI, so choose those if Carbon is not the right fit.

> Prefer the `oauth-proxy` flavours, unless you have a specific reason to not use it.

> **NOTE:** The `main` branch has been renamed to `local-auth` and `oauth-proxy` is the new default branch.

### How to Use It

#### Setup with [create-cen-app](https://github.com/felixpahlke/create-cen-app) and choose "full-stack-cen-template"

```bash
npm create cen-app@latest
```

#### Or clone manually (commands may vary by flavour - check the specific branch):

- Clone this repository manually, set the name with the name of the project you want to use, for example `my-full-stack`:

```bash
git clone -b local-auth git@github.ibm.com:client-engineering-dach/full-stack-cen-template.git my-full-stack
```

- Enter into the new directory:

```bash
cd my-full-stack
```

- Set the new origin to your new repository (copy from GitHub interface):

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.ibm.com:my-username/my-full-stack.git
```

- Add the template repository as upstream to get future updates:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.ibm.com:client-engineering-dach/full-stack-cen-template.git
```

- Rename branch to main:

```bash
git branch -m main
```

- Push the code to your new repository:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Update From the Original Template

After cloning the repository, and after doing changes, you might want to get the latest changes from this original template.

- Make sure you added the original repository as a remote, you can check it with:

```bash
git remote -v

origin    git@github.ibm.com:my-username/my-full-stack.git (fetch)
origin    git@github.ibm.com:my-username/my-full-stack.git (push)
upstream    git@github.ibm.com:client-engineering-dach/full-stack-cen-template.git (fetch)
upstream    git@github.ibm.com:client-engineering-dach/full-stack-cen-template.git (push)
```

- Pull the latest changes without merging (commands may vary by flavour - check the specific branch):

```bash
git pull --no-commit upstream local-auth
```

This will download the latest changes from this template without committing them, that way you can check everything is right before committing.

- If there are conflicts, solve them in your editor.

- Once you are done, commit the changes:

```bash
git merge --continue
```
